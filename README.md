# Macula

## TL;DR

_Macula_ is Latin for "spot", referring to the nature of the kind of infrastructure this project is targeting: a decentralized and distributed mesh of tiny-node, low-cost, low-power clusters.

Recent world events have shown once more that nothing is certain: decades-old alliances we took for granted seem to be prone to collapse at the drop of a hat and prove to be vulnerable to personal agendas of political and economic madmen.

This project aims at building a democratic, open-source and crowdsourced platform, outside of the influence of Big Tech and Big Politics, that is still capable of running meaningful workloads.

It is a radical departure from the current industry mindset of moving towards centralized, big cloud platforms, which in essence comes down to giving up control over data to institutions and corporations we don't control or even trust.

## CHALLENGES  

It is important to understand that in order to build a truly decentralized and autonomous platform, the foundations of such a system must also be decentralized and autonomous, starting with power provisioning all the way up to the administration and governance of that system. 

In practice, this means that platforms like _Macula_ must be built on top of a decentralized network of nodes, which must be able to communicate with each other, and that these nodes must be able to run workloads, which are themselves decentralized and autonomous.

### Energy

Decentralization of power provisioning is not an unknown field. Solar, wind or even small hydro generators can be used to power the nodes of a decentralized network, but they all suffer from the same problems as large-scale solutions: energy storage.  
Initiatives like [EnergyVision](https://energyvision.be), that offer investment-free consumer oriented solutions.
